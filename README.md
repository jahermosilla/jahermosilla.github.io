# My personal website

This is the project for my personal website. It's a Vue 3 project created with Vite.

This project is heavily inspired in the Vitese Starter project, and it uses some of the Vite plugins and features that Vitese uses, such as:


- ðŸ—‚ [File based routing](https://github.com/hannoeru/vite-plugin-pages)

- ðŸ“¦ [Components auto importing](https://github.com/antfu/unplugin-vue-components)

- ðŸ“‘ [Layout system](https://github.com/JohnCampionJr/vite-plugin-vue-layouts)

- ðŸŽ¨ [Windi CSS](https://github.com/windicss/windicss) - next generation utility-first CSS framework

- ðŸ“¥ [APIs auto importing](https://github.com/antfu/unplugin-auto-import) - use Composition API and others directly
