    Prodevelop is a medium size company whose main focus is the portuary sector.
    I have worked in several internal products, such as: Posidonia Space, Local Space,...
    My main project in the company, Mia Tracking, was an ad-hoc project for an insurancy comany, that consisted in a web application that tracked realtime fleet positions and status to target incidents.
    I did a lot of things and used a lot of technologies such as message brokers (Kafka),
    Dockerization of projects.
    I also helped the I+D team dockerizing and deploying a machine learning model!
